This is my project for my OCR Computer Science (H446) A level.

It is a Physics Engine/ Simulator that I am programming from scratch in C and OpenGL.

I take Physics, Maths and Further Maths along with Computer Science A levels so this project is the perfect way to tie together all I am learning in all of my subjects.
